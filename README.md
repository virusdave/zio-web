ZIO Web supports the features you need to be productive:

 * **Endpoints**. Define reliable and scalable endpoints concisely, type-safely, and composably.
 * **Protocol-Agnostic**. Deploy endpoints to any supported protocol, including HTTP and gRPC.
 * **Stream-friendly**. Handle requests and responses that are too big to fit in memory at once.
   * WebSockets
 * Introspection-friendly
   * **Documentation**. Generate documentation that is automatically in-sync with the endpoints.
   * **Client**. Interact with an endpoint type-safely from Scala without writing any code.
 * Middleware-friendly
   * **Metrics/Monitoring**. Built-in integration with ZIO ZMX.
   * **Rate-limiting**. Customizable rate-limiting with DDOS protection.
   * Via third-party libraries, pluggable authentication, authorization, persistence, caching, session management
 * **High-performance**. Fastest functional Scala library.

   * Minimal / no type classes, implicits, or higher-kinded types
   * Highly discoverable API

## Protocols

ZIO Web supports the following protocols out-of-the-box:

 - Codec superpowers?
 - Protocol-specific middleware?
 - Annotations, specifically HTTP?
 - OpenAPI?

## Installation

Add in your `build.sbt`:

```scala
libraryDependencies += "dev.zio" %% "zio-http-core" % "<version>"
```
